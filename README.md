# MultiThreadExample

This project is very simple example that shows how to control multiple threads in Android. 

It is really important to know this concept and get to know how to control multiple threads when you deal with anything related to multi threading architecture, such as network and multimedia.

# Structure of this Example
There are two threads (Thread A and Thread B). 
Each thread has its own while loop that counts numbers infinitely.

There are a total number of "9 buttons" that are very much self-explanatory if you take a look at the .xml file.

#1 Button: START ALL

#2 Button: PAUSE THREAD A

#3 Button: RESUME THREAD A

#4 Button: STOP THREAD A

#5 Button: PAUSE THREAD B 

#6 Button: RESUME THREAD B

#7 Button:  STOP THREAD B

#8 Button: RESTART ALL

#8 Button: STOP ALL


Clone it and check it out.
